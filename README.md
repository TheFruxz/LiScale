# 👋 Welcome to LiScale

LiScale is a small fun-project from me. I tried to create a licensing service, to distribute your own license keys.
This project is currently under heavy development and a proper wiki will follow soon.

# 🎯 Goals

The goal of this service is, to provide an easy-to-use way, to distribute your software easily.

# 📝 ToDo

These are the things, that are currently on the ToDo list

- [ ] Create the Server Infrastructure
- [ ] Create (Kotlin, Java, ...) APIs, to access licensing servers easily
- [ ] Create Web-Panel for easy configuration (and stock installations)
